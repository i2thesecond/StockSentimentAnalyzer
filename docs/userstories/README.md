Acceptance criteria.
For each story, define at least one acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria define the set of requirements that tell you when you are done with the user story.

Mis-user stories
In addition to the user stories identify the ways in which users might be able to mis-use your app. Mis-user stories are just like user stories except the user, goal, and rationale are malicious.

Mitigation Criteria
For each mis-user story identify at least one mitigation criteria. The mitigation criteria define the set of requirements that tell you when you are done protecting against the mis-user story.
